          <div className="explainer-content">
            Coding is the process of writing instructions for computers in a
            language they can understand. It involves creating logical sequences
            of steps that a computer can carry out to achieve a specific outcome
            or to solve a problem. Coding is a key component of software
            development, as well as web development, mobile app development, and
            other areas of computing. The code tells a computer how to think,
            act, and respond to user input.
            <br />
            <br /> Coding has been around since the 1950s when the first
            programming languages were developed. Since then, the field has
            grown dramatically, with many different coding languages and
            frameworks having been created over time. Today, coding is an
            essential skill for many tech professionals and businesses to
            develop software and applications for modern technology platforms.

            Coding is an essential skill in the modern world and offers a wide
            range of advantages. From creating interactive web applications to
            developing software, coding can help individuals and businesses make
            the most of their resources. Here are just some of the many benefits
            that coding can offer:

              Coding is a powerful tool that can be used in countless ways to
              create amazing products. While the traditional uses of coding are
              often seen in website and app development, there are a wide
              variety of creative uses for coding that businesses can leverage
              to create something truly unique.
              <br />
              <br />
              One innovative way to use coding is to create interactive data
              visualizations. Data visualization provides an easy-to-understand
              way for businesses to make sense of their data. By using coding,
              you can create visualizations that can be interacted with and
              manipulated to give even more insight into your data.
            </div>
            <div>
              Another way to use coding is to create augmented reality (AR)
              experiences. Using coding and augmented reality technology,
              businesses can create interactive 3D experiences that users can
              view through their devices. This technology has already been used
              in marketing campaigns and could be used to engage customers and
              employees in unique ways.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="background-yellow">
            Finally, coding can be used to develop AI-driven chatbots that are
            able to interact with customers in real time. By leveraging natural
            language processing and machine learning, chatbots can respond to
            customer inquiries, provide personalized recommendations, and more.
